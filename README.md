# a-presentation-and-paper-on-decoy-routing

This is a seminar paper and presentation I wrote on the subject of decoy routing - a method used to circumvent Internet censorship by a governing authority. The scientific paper that
my project is based on is "Game of Decoys: Optimal Decoy Routing Through Game Theory" by Milad Nasr and Amir Houmansadr. You'll find the full details of this paper and two other papers I used in my References
section at the end of my summary.
